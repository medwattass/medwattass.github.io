# Mohamed Wattas - Portfolio

## Description

This is my first web page which is a portfolio that I created when I was learning Web Application Developement. I was so excited to make my own website
that will be presenting my resume. I practiced using bootstrap, making and editing animations in order to make this project a sucess.
